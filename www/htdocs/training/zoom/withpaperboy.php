			<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
			<TD VALIGN=TOP>How to Win an Election is an ancient Roman guide for campaigning that is as up-to-date as 
		tomorrow's headlines. In 64 BC when idealist Marcus Cicero, Rome's greatest orator, ran for
		consul <I>(the highest office in the Republic)</I>, his practical 
		brother Quintus decided he needed some no-nonsense advice on running a successful campaign. 
		<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
		
		What follows in his short letter are timeless bits of political wisdom, from the importance of
		promising everything to everybody and reminding voters about the sexual scandals of your 
		opponents to being a chameleon, putting on a good show for the masses, and constantly surrounding 
		yourself with rabid supporters. 
		
		<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
		Presented here in a lively and colorful new translation, with 
		the Latin text on facing pages, this unashamedly pragmatic primer on the humble art of personal 
		politicking is dead-on <I>(Cicero won)</I> and as relevant today as when it was written.
