RepMyBlock was created to reform the Democratic party, but it's evident that the NYPD has turned into a military force that fights against those they are supposed to protect.

		<P>
Pat Lynch, the current president of the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, completely tones death to the need of the citizen of this city.
		</P>
		<P>
This website aims to help the community identify officers that want to become leaders and for the community to back them up in their quest to replace Pat Lynch and it's the board.
		</P>
		<P>
We believe that the PBA can do its mandate of protecting its members while at the same time working on solutions that will help office protect and serve the community they swore to protect.
		</P>
		<P>
If you are an NYPD officer in a position to run for one of the leadership PBA positions, please contact us, and we'll work on a plan.
