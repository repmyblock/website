	<P>
		<B>
			The process to run for County Committee is basically the same

	<H3>The First Step</H3>
	
	<P>
		The first step is simply saying, "I am doing it." The process will not 
		make much sence but everything is like that as to disuade people from running. We
		built this website to streamline the process to remove all the hoops 
		from  running.

	<P>
		The party, like any Non Profit Organisation or For Profit Corporation has bylaws.
		You can find the bylaws of the various Democratic Party County Committee here.
